# NGMX Blinky
Python script that shows the current energy mix for the UK grid using:

a Pi Zero W and an old fashioned Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT.

(Probably easy enough to get working with one of the fancy new ones too).

## Why?

It is also a good conversation starter on the energy mix on the grid. Armed with that
information you can make good choices about when to do things - put the washing machine on
when the sun is high e.g.

But don't feel bad about that late night cuppa fuelled by gas.

Next step - break the washing machine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtgMESLjLoQ ? ;-)
